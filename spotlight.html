        <p>One of my most favorite projects was a 2D platformer I created in GameMaker Studio 2. I did not have a repository for the code unfortunately. <br>
        This was a solo project for a couple months in a game development class in my program. "Running in the Night" is a story that follows a curious cursor exploring the inside of a computer that was left running all night. All the art you will see in this game was drawn by me inside GameMaker's sprite editor.</p>

        <p>I followed a Drag n' Drop tutorial for a platformer game by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dGpCsnQ7AWRJQPWUWUjLFVWeIkcIdN4">Slyddar</a> on youtube, then began altering things to fit my setting as I followed through. <br>
            I then created a sample level displaying the basic gameplay. It stil had issues I had to fix and was far from complete.</p>

        <p>This was a large jump that took several updates to polish a bit more. I added animations, backgrounds, levels to fit the story, and an ending. The idea of fighting against the game itself is interesting, but the player is not always in control of the world they're in. </p>

        <p>The final touchup I needed was to update the title screen. I had a lot of fun with designing this part. </p>
